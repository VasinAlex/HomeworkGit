				<p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup instructions,
					they've moved to <a href="#">their own section</a>. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation,
					Native Components, React, and more!</p>

				<p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app
					platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as
					to
					describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="ptsans-italic">bundles of
						reusable, nestable code.</span> You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover
					how
					components work in React Native.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section chapter3">
				<h2 class="francoisone section-title">react fundamentals
					<sup class="farro"> Chapter 3</sup>
				</h2>

				<p>React Native runs on <a href="#">React</a>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
					JavaScript. To make
					the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve
					as
					a refresher course.</p>

				<p>
					We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="ptsans-bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
					examples:
					friendly, approachable creatures
					that need names and a cafe to work in.
				</p>

				<p><span class="ptsans-bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements
					inside JavaScript like so: <span class="textbg-grey">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.
				</p>

				<p>
					The React docs have <a href="#">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can refer to learn even
					more. Because JSX is JavaScript,
					you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="textbg-grey">name</span> for the cat,
					name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="textbg-grey">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="ptsans-bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="ptsans-bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
					components render, state is like a
					component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from
					user interaction. State gives your components memory!
				</p>

			</div>

			<div class="section chapter4">
				<h2 class="francoisone section-title">handling text input
					<sup class="farro">Chapter 4</sup>
				</h2>

				<p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
						class="ptsans-italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a
					function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing
					prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>

				<p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In
					this new language, every single word is written the same way: <span class="scale">üçï</span>. So the sentence
					"Hello there Bob" would be translated as "<span class="scale">üçï üçï</span>".</p>
